 // Quick Sort 
 /*
 - Like Merge sort , exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sort 
 -Works by selecting one element (called the Pivot) and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array
 -Once the pivot is positoned appropriately , quick sort can be applied on the either side of the pivot
