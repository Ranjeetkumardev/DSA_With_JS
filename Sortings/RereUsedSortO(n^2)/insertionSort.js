//  Build up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is allways sorted
/*
 -Start picking the second elements in the array 
 -Now compare the second elements with one before it and swap if necessary 
 - continue to the next element and if it in the incorrect order iterate through the sorted portion (i.e left side ) to place the element in the correct place 
 -Repeat untill the array is sorted
